# Tests

This directory contains instructions for testing, and, eventually, automated tests.

The directory `manifests/` contains useful manifests for testing.

## End-to-End Tests

What end-to-end tests are required to test the CCM?

Currently, these are performed manually, but executing each of the steps in each section of this document.

In the next phase, we should create a single `make` target that runs them all. These require a Cherry Servers account
and token, deploying several real devices.

Eventually, these should be part of the CI flow.

The user flow is expected to be:

```console
export CHERRY_API_KEY=<my auth token>
make integration-tests
```

### Prerequisites

In order to test the CCM, we need a Kubernetes cluster with at least some of the nodes - control plane or worker - on
Cherry Servers, depending on the test. For simplicity sake, all tests will use a cluster, all of whose nodes, both
control plane and worker, are on Cherry Servers.

It is not necessary to deploy the CCM onto the cluster, as the CCM can run in standalone mode.
This makes the testing part of the lifecycle simpler.

### Tests

The functionality that needs to be tested is as follows:

* node management - provider ID, deletion, metadata
* load balancer service - addition, update, deletion
* control plane FIP

#### Node Management

* add new Cherry server to cluster, check that:
  * node receives provider ID
  * provider ID aligns with server ID in Cherry Servers
  * node receives appropriate metadata as labels, specifically: type, addresses, region
* remove Cherry server by deleting, check that:
  * Kubernetes deletes the node

#### LoadBalancer Services

As there are different loadbalancer implementations, these require different tests:

##### kube-vip, bgp

Deploying kube-vip is described on the [kube-vip home page](https://kube-vip.io/).

1. Start with 0 services of `type=LoadBalancer`
1. add 2 services of `type=LoadBalancer`, check that:
  * FIPs are created, have correct tags
  * BGP is enabled for project
  * BGP is enabled on each node with the services
  * annotations are created on each node, specifically, multiple of: local ASN, peer ASN, local IP, peer IP
1. delete 1 service of `type=LoadBalancer`, check that:
  * FIP is removed
  * annotations remain
  * FIP for 2nd service remains
1. delete 2nd service of `type=LoadBalancer`, check that:
  * FIP is removed
  * annotations are removed

##### metallb

Deploying metallb is describe on the [metallb home page](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/).
As of this writing, the only thing you need to do is:

```sh
METALLB_VERSION=$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/metallb/metallb/releases | jq -r ".[0].name")
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/${METALLB_VERSION}/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml
```


1. Start with 0 services of `type=LoadBalancer`
1. add 2 services of `type=LoadBalancer`, check that:
  * FIPs are created, have correct tags
  * BGP is enabled for project
  * BGP is enabled on each node with the services
  * metallb configmap is modified to include:
    * an addresses entry for each service
    * a node entry for each combination of node and upstream peer
1. delete 1 service of `type=LoadBalancer`, check that:
  * FIP is removed
  * configmap remains, with address entry for 1st service removed
  * FIP for 2nd service remains
1. delete 2nd service of `type=LoadBalancer`, check that:
  * FIP is removed
  * configmap is emptied

#### Control Plane FIP

This requires a control plane of 3 nodes; workers are not necessary.

1. Create the control plane nodes.
1. Create the FIP, tagged with a unique tag.
1. Start CCM with the tag passed.
1. Check that the FIP has been attached to one of the control plane nodes.
1. Delete one of the non-FIP-attached nodes; check that the FIP remains attached to the same node.
1. Disable one of the FIP-attached nodes, but do not delete from Cherry API; check that the FIP is detached from that node and attached to the remaining node.
